Basic implementations
[x] Planar flow
[x] VAE, and VAE with planar flow
[x] Binarized MNIST dataset and data loader
[] Loss function 
[] Training and testing of MNIST

To Angeliki:
1. I have tested the flow and VAE with flow implementation. You can continue from that. I wrote a few lines of examples on how to define these models.

2. The loss.py file is copied from Sylvester flow. But I haven't tried it or tested it. I think you can write your own version of loss function using that as a reference.

3. You also need to write training and testing code of MNIST. I think you can work on *Colab* and forget about that `main_VAE.py` file.
